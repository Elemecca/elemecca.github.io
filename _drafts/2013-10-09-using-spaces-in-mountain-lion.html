<p>I'm an obsessive user of virtual desktops, in large part because I often have several unrelated tasks I'm working on in parallel. I always jump directly to the desktop I want with keyboard shortcuts; graphical switchers and linear navigation just confuse me. On my personal Windows machines I have 12 desktops managed by <a href="http://virtuawin.sourceforge.net/" title="VirtualWin virtual desktop manager for Windows">VirtuaWin</a>. At the company where I started working a month ago we use Macs. </p>
<p>has been combined with Exposé to form the new Mission Control feature. The grid overlay when switching spaces has been removed, and the meta-space has been merged into the top of the Exposé view. Spaces can only be arranged as a line instead of a grid. </p>
