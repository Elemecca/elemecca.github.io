<p>While it's not as bad as it used to be, there are still plenty of areas where the major browsers behave quite differently. These days they're usually DOM level 0 components that have never been formally specified, although <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-view/" target="_blank">the upcoming CSSOM View specification</a> should help with that. There are also areas that the specifications either explicitly declare implementation-defined or fail to cover in sufficient detail. Not to be ignored is Internet Explorer's infamous devil-may-care attitude towards standards, although that's starting to change. At any rate, this is a collection of links to documentation of these less-than-standard areas of browser behavior, both my own and others'.</p>
