<p>To create a reasonably responsive and performant web application these days it's generally necessary to use client-side JavaScript to drive the user interface. No-one wants to sit through an entire page load when they switch tabs within a page. Some simple navigational elements (like tabs) can be handled by returning more information in the page than is initially displayed and changing what's displayed later with JavaScript. Doing much of anything beyond that generally requires a more heavyweight application on the client backed by some sort of web API. That design, however, results in apps like Google's Blogger which show as a mostly-blank page for those of us who use NoScript. It is therefore necessary to at least partly duplicate the functionality of the client-side application on the server for the benefit of search engines and other JavaScript-impaired users. That duplication tends to result in fragile </p>
