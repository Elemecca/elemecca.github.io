<p>I just finished installing Windows 8 drivers for all the hardware in my new laptop. One device in particular, <code>ACPI\VEN_ATK&amp;DEV_4001</code>, stumped me for quite a while. There's no open, centralized database for ACPI IDs like there is for <a href="http://pciids.sourceforge.net/" title="pci.ids">PCI</a> and <a href="http://www.linux-usb.org/usb-ids.html" title="usb.ids">USB</a>. All I knew was that it was made by Asus (ATK is their vendor code) and searching Google was turning up nothing. I eventually resorted to looking at the ini files from random drivers on the Asus site for the UX31A until I found a match. Apparently it's the wireless radio control interface, used to enter airplane mode from the Windows UI. It's covered by the "ASUS Wireless Radio Control" driver in the "Utilities" section of <a href="http://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/ASUS_ZENBOOK_UX31A/#support_Download">the download page</a>.</p>
